This is a project for my CBS exam in Programming, Algorithms and Data Structure course. The project I made is about a Housing Platform to help international students that are coming in Copenhagen search
for their ideal accomondation. This project uses object-oriented programming, sorting and searching algorithms and implements Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and folium to visualize the results
and make it more interactive and user-friendly.
